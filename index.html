            <h1>My Dream</h1>
            <h2>Be Positive</h2>
            <p class="objective">If you find yourself identifying with the pessimist profile, don’t be discouraged. With
                mental strength and daily training, you will be able to create good in any situation. Starting with your
                speech, eliminate negative phrases such as “I can’t”, “I always give up”, or “I am *insert negative
                adjective*”. For example, you may have found yourself saying, “I am lazy.” A better way to frame this in
                your mind is “Today I did not accomplish as much as I wanted to. I will make a list for tomorrow so I
                can complete all of my tasks!” Additionally, try to avoid complaining at all costs. If you are working
                with a particularly difficult client, try to view the experience as a positive challenge rather than a
                negative situation. This will allow you to remain in good spirits and help the client in the most
                productive way possible.</p>
